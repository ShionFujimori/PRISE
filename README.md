# PriseApp
We are an online platform connecting student organizations and companies to sponsorships and branding opportunities.

Companies will have access to curated lists of committed student organizations. They can find the fittest one they need for branding, very efficiently, saving time in the process, while maintaining total control over the selection process. 

Student organizations can have everything done from receiving funds to enclosing contracts all in one. We are here to reduce the complexity and time-consuming nature of finalizing sponsorships. Also, student organizations gain extra visibility to the company's attention.
